                        Notorious for having dynamic speed limits that give drivers a chance to travel more than 100 miles per hour, car enthusiasts and speed demons love trips along the German Autobhan. But, if you run out of gas, you could face a big fine. And don't even think
                        of walking to a gas station; you'll get another fine for that! Why? Germans believe you have the power to keep your car properly gassed up, so if you run out of gas, it's your own fault. Walking along the highway is unsafe, as
                        is having your vehicle stalled on or on the side of the road. Keep your eyes on your gas gauge and fill 'er up when you get low.
